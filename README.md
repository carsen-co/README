## Discontinued due to scraping sometimes not being an acceptable practice on the web, so all of the tools developed and publicly available are just for educational purposes.

This is a set of tools developed to analyse the European car market, starting with the German one. The idea behind this project is to index all vehicles, and based upon your preferences (car type, budget, etc.), suggest the best vehicle based on multiple criteria (mileage, options, registration year) which would be both a good financial investment and fit for the user.

Works on the principle of scraping and analysing data using various algorithm, to yield the best results found on a car website. Interestingly enough, when tested on websites which had their own car scoring algorithm in place, these tools would frequently yield the same results as best.
